Hi my name is Atessa Amjadi. I am from Bethesda, Maryland. I went to Walt
Whitman HS. I have an older sister named Nina who went to Colorado Boulder. 
She is six years older than me. Today I went to two classes and then I attended
 my group project at the rathskeller with my 3 other group members.
 So far its going good. Slowly but getting there. Woohoo.
