Hi my name is Atessa Amjadi. I am from Bethesda, Maryland. I went to Walt
Whitman HS. I have an older sister named Nina who went to Colorado Boulder. 
She is six years older than me. Today I went to two classes and then I attended
 my group project at the rathskeller with my 3 other group members.
 So far its going good. Slowly but getting there. Woohoo. 

Then my group member, Nathan, wrote this paragraph in the story. It was kind
strange, because he was writing it from my perspective rather than his.
Nathan wrote sentence after sentence after sentence, like two, before
finishing. He then ended his section, added, committed, and pushed.

Then my favorite group member Declan crashed into this story. I don't know what
else to write on this one. So this is my awesome paragraph.

Then my next collaborator added lines but conflict happened. so we tried to fixe it.
I think he can speak more than two languages: french, spanish, german. We all hope
that there will be no more conflict.

My story is kind of boring but my group members are great. We are thriving 
currently, and almost finished well before the due date. We work very well 
together. Right now it is about 9:03 p.m. and I am excited to go home and to
sleep/study. I am also hungry so maybe I will grab a snack before I leave
